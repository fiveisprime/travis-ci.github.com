Travis CI can automatically deploy your [Modulus](https://modulus.io/) application after a successful build.

For a minimal configuration, all you need to do is add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

    deploy:
      provider: modulus
      api_key: "YOUR API KEY"
      project_name: "YOUR PROJECT NAME"

You can create an API key by running `modulus token create` or retrieve an existing one by running `modulus token list`.
It is recommended to encrypt that key. Assuming you have the Modulus and Travis CI command line clients installed, you can do it like this:

    $ modulus token create
    Welcome to Modulus
    You are logged in as USER
    [âœ“] Token: THE-API-TOKEN
    ...
    $ travis encrypt THE-API-TOKEN --add deploy.api_key

Keep in mind that the above command has to run in your project directory, so it can modify the `.travis.yml` for you.

### Branch to deploy from

By default, Travis CI will only deploy from your **master** branch.

You can explicitly specify the branch to deploy from with the **on** option:

    deploy:
      provider: modulus
      api_key: ...
      project_name: ...
      on: production

Alternatively, you can also configure it to deploy from all branches:

    deploy:
      provider: modulus
      api_key: ...
      project_name: ...
      on:
        all_branches: true

Builds triggered from Pull Requests will never trigger a deploy.

### Deploying build artifacts

After your tests run and before the deploy, Travis CI will clean up any additional files and changes you made.

Maybe that is not what you want, as you might generate some artifacts (think asset compilation) that are supposed to be deployed, too. There is now an option to skip the clean up:

    deploy:
      provider: modulus
      api_key: ...
      project_name: ...
      skip_cleanup: true

### Conditional Deploys

It is possible to make deployments conditional using the **on** option:

    deploy:
      provider: modulus
      api_key: ...
      project_name: ...
      on:
        branch: staging
        node: 0.11

The above configuration will trigger a deploy if the staging branch is passing on NodeJS 0.11.

Available conditions are:

* **all_branches** - when set to true, trigger deploy from any branch if passing
* **branch** - branch or list of branches to deploy from if passing
* **tags** - when set to true, Travis CI only deploys on tagged builds
* **condition** - custom condition or list of custom conditions
* **node** - NodeJS version to deploy from if passing
* **repo** - only trigger a build for the given repository, to play nice with forks

### Running commands before and after deploy

Sometimes you want to run commands before or after deploying. You can use the `before_deploy` and `after_deploy` stages for this. These will only be triggered if Travis CI is actually deploying.

    before_deploy: "echo 'ready?'"
    deploy:
      ..
    after_deploy:
      - ./after_deploy_1.sh
      - ./after_deploy_2.sh
